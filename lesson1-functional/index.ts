/**
 * Imagine we were building some logic for an POS system payment device.
 * We can use TypeScript's type aliasing to make many domain specific types explicit.
 * Note, for example, how some of the Domain Events contain the same data (or none at all other than ids),
 * yet the named type itself represents some domain concept that is not the same as the others that have the same "shape". 
 * 
 * This highlights how domain events are themselves not just data, but represent actual real-world "things".
 * By using a robust type system, they can be made explicit.
 *
 * Implications of this include code that reads much clearer, focusing on domain semantics vs. technical jargon.
 * 
 * Note: Any code comments beginning with "#### Action ####" means it's code that you can uncomment to interact with ðŸ˜Š.

// No information about the _type_ being serialized is stored! 
// How do we know what kind of event it is when deserializing?
//
// We'll need to store the type along with the event itself... let's try again!
// npm package `ts-nameof` gives us a way to "get" the type (this is one of a few ways). 
// (It enables a new global function "nameof()")

// Let's define a "Meta" type that will store both the event AND the type ðŸ˜…

    // the type in order to decide what effect that event
    // has against our projection.
