/**
 * How do we test event sourced systems?
 * 
 * It's actually fairly straightfoward - and this technique exposes how focusing
 * on the domain events rather than state (as our industry is so often doing)
 * makes our software easier to read, work with from a domain semantics POV, to test, etc.
 * 
 * We'll use the projection we created in the previous lesson for testing ;)
